/*
 Explanation of volatile Keyword
The volatile keyword in Java is used to ensure visibility of changes to variables across threads.

ðŸ”¸ Problem Without volatile
If flag were not marked as volatile, the readerThread might:

Cache the value of flag in its CPU core.

Never see the update made by writerThread, leading to an infinite loop in while (!flag).

This is due to CPU-level caching and compiler optimizations in a multithreaded environment.

ðŸ”¸ What volatile Does:
Prevents Caching: Tells the JVM that flag is shared, so it must always read the latest value from main memory.

Guarantees Visibility: Any write to a volatile variable by one thread is visible to all other threads.

Does NOT Provide Atomicity: volatile is not suitable for operations like count++ or check-then-act, which require atomicity (use AtomicInteger or synchronized blocks for that).

âœ… When to Use volatile
Use volatile when:

Only one thread writes, others only read.

The variable is used as a flag or signal (as in our example).

Operations on the variable are independent (no compound actions).
